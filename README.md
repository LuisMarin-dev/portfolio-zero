# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Welcome to my Porfolio!
This is not only the home for my projects but also my first attempt at 3D elements on a Web App. This project was built using:

React.js, React Three Fiber (which is the library for ThreeJS in React), TailwindCSS and Framer Motion (a library for React animations).

# 3D Elements
Here I learned to Load, Creating and Customizing both 3D elements and geometries in different lightings.
